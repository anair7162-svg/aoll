       <p>A private company operating the first United States moon landing attempt in more than 50 years has admitted there is "no chance" of its spacecraft making a soft landing on the surface following a "critical" fuel leak.<br><br>
        Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology managed to orient its lander towards the sun so the solar panel could collect sunlight and charge its battery, as a special team assessed the status of what was termed "a failure in the propulsion system".<br><br>
        But it soon became apparent there was "a critical loss of fuel", eventually dashing hopes for what had been a planned moon landing on February 23.<br><br>
        Earlier this morning, the company said after 32 hours of operation, the craft's batteries were fully charged but it was expected to run out of propellant in about 40 hours.<br><br>
"Given the propellant leak, there is, unfortunately, no chance of a soft landing on the moon," Astrobotic said.<br><br>
The trouble was first reported about seven hours after Monday's pre-dawn (afternoon AEDT) lift-off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.<br><br>
United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket provided the lift for Astrobotic's lander, named Peregrine, putting it on a long, roundabout path to the moon.<br><br>
The lander is equipped with engines and thrusters for manoeuvring, not only during the cruise to the moon but for lunar descent.<br><br>
Astrobotic released a photo from a lander-mounted camera, which the company said showed a "disturbance" in a section of thermal insulation. That aligns with what is known so far of the problem, the company said.<br><br>
Astrobotic was aiming to be the first private business to successfully land on the moon, something only four countries have accomplished. A second lander from a Houston company is due to launch next month. NASA gave the two companies millions to build and fly their own lunar landers.<br><br>
The space agency wants the privately owned landers to scope out the place before astronauts arrive while delivering tech and science experiments for the space agency, other countries and universities as well as odds and ends for other customers. Astrobotic's contract with NASA for the Peregrine lander was $108 million ($161 million) and it has more in the pipeline.<br><br>
Before the flight, NASA's Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration, noted that while using private companies to make deliveries to the moon would be cheaper and quicker than going the usual government route, there would be added risk. He stressed that the space agency was willing to accept that risk.<br><br>

"Each success and setback are opportunities to learn and grow," he said on Monday.<br><br>
The last time the US launched a moon-landing mission was in December 1972. Apollo 17's Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt became the 11th and 12th men to walk on the moon, closing out an era that has remained NASA's pinnacle.<br><br>
The space agency's new Artemis program — named after the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology — looks to return astronauts to the moon's surface within the next few years. First will be a lunar fly-around with four astronauts, possibly before the end of the year.<br><br>
