        CES 2024 is full of innovative delights, futuristic concepts, practical products you can preorder or buy today and some of strangest tech to stumble across our paths. Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives. <br><br>
        
        As we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies, new car tech, gaming gear and robots -- there's even a robot for your dog.<br><br>
        
        Here's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.<br><br>

        Banish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter.<br><br> As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard, or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.<br><br>

        As we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle which could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the "board room on wheels" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs! <br><br>
        The most impressive, and most-likely concepts to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing "steer-by-wire" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new "floating H" logo. <br><br>

        What to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch one C Seed showed off at CES 2024.<br><br>

The custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture, and its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk in about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV. <br><br>

Oh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.<br><br>

If you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer, electrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was unveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you "beam it," the device can give you clues about your health. <br><br>

The device, which Withings describes as being "portable and smaller than a smartphone," combines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of the wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like blood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used as a "digital stethoscope."<br><br>

Following expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250. <br><br>
